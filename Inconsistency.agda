-- Constructive Provability Logic 
-- The minimal, modal, propositional fragment
-- Robert J. Simmons, Bernardo Toninho

-- Illustration of why constructive probability logic demands an 
-- upwards-well-founded accessibility relation; with a trivial one-place
-- reflexive accessibility relation, the definition of constructive provability
-- logic makes the *metalogic* (Agda, in this case), inconsistent.

Q = a "q"
it's-true : ◇ Q at <> :: [] ⊢ Q [ <> ]

-- Step two (only necessary because we're not in a sequent calculus)
-- Show that ◇Q[w] ⊢ ◇A[q] implies Q is equal to A; we can't prove much else.

-- Step three
-- Show that there can be no proof of ◇Q[w] ⊢ Q[w] by "structural induction"
-- on our (nonpositive) inductive definition. Agda believes us because it sees
-- "D₂ <> (anything)" as a structural subterm of (◇E D₁ D₂).
