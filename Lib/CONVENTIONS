This is a redesign of Dan Licata (et al)'s Agda standard library that also
borrows heavily and shamelessly from Agda's standard library where useful
and appropriate.

Design goals:

* Look like standard-ish Haskell
  - Constructors and types are capitalized (Nat, S, Z)
  - 

* Limit the use of Unicode - Unicode runs rampant in the standard library, and
it means that its sometimes hard to even know how to write code. 
  - Σ - \sigma
  - ∀ - \forall
  - ∃ - \exists
  - × - \times
  - λ - \lambda
